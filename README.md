# AI Analysis of Stack Overflow Survey 2023

A Database application developed using SQL for relational database, Flet for User interface, and hosted on the cloud, that gives us interesting insights about the current state of developers around the world with respect to their opinion towards using AI in their work

## Problem & Description

This project takes data from the Stack Overflow Survey of 2023 which is opensource and publicly accessible.
It contains data from over 24,000 developers who filled the survey asking their preferences, various information about the frameworks/languages they use daily etc.

As the project progressed I also thought it would be interesting to also include insights about how developers use AI due to the AI boom that has been going on in the past 3 years.

In 2023 Stack Overflow included a new AI section which highlights how the current trend is in the industry towards AI adoption. Fields such as:

1. Project Planning
2. Learn about Code base
3. Documenting Code
4. Writing Code
5. Debugging and Getting Help
6. Testing Code
7. Committing and Reviewing Code
8. Deployment and Monitoring
9. Collaborating with teammates

and many more fields show us how present Developers are adapting to the AI boom
